## üöÄ About This Project

What started as a passion for gaming and code has morphed into this‚Äîa central hub for all my gaming projects. This repo holds the keys to the kingdom, containing all the source code for the main website. The goal is to create a cool spot on the web for both in-depth resources for AAA titles and a collection of original, playable games.

### ‚ú® Core Features:

* üéÆ **Game Hubs:** A curated collection of deep-dive resource sites for major gaming franchises.
* üí° **Original Games:** A showcase of more substantial, original games built from the ground up.
* üïπÔ∏è **Classic Arcade:** A fun section of simple, retro web games for a quick nostalgia trip.
* üì± **Fully Responsive:** Built to look and work great whether you're on a 4K monitor or your phone.

## üõ†Ô∏è The Tech Stack

Powered by some awesome tech to keep things fast, modern, and snappy:

* **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)**: The React framework that handles all the heavy lifting.
* **[React](https://reactjs.org/)**: For building out the interactive UI components.
* **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**: Because writing CSS from scratch is a pain.
* **[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)**: For hosting and deployment.

## üìÇ How It's Organized

Here's a quick map of the codebase and how the site is structured so you can find your way around:

* **/hubs:** This is where the logic lives for the gallery of large, dedicated game resource sites (the ones that link out to other domains like `codrcg.com`).
* **/games:** Contains the more complex, original games I've built from scratch (like the Tower Defense project).
* **/arcade:** Home to the simple, classic web games that are playable directly on the site.

## ‚öñÔ∏è License & Usage

**Long story short: All Rights Reserved.**

This is a source-available project. Feel free to clone it, poke around the code, see how things work, and learn from it. However, since this is also my main business portfolio, I've got to keep the code itself proprietary.

Please **do not** copy, modify, or redistribute it for your own projects without getting in touch with me first.
